# FriendFinder
This is a website called Friend Finder that matches a user to another a person that would be most likely to be friends with them based on the answers that they give in a survey. What the user does is that they will answer a series of questions of statement that they feel would describe them as a person on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 being the least like them and 5 being the most like them) along with a question that askes about their alignment. After the user hits the 'submit' button at the bottom of the page, they will be given the name and picture of a person that most closely matches them in terms of how close their answers are on the forms. This particular site runs using express, jQuery, fs, and several other components.
